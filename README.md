Facebook-bot:

This script has the following functionality:

1 Post Something. : used to post text and our media to some url

2 Groups Scraper. : used to extract a list of names and Facebook profile links of members of a group and write's that data into *-members.txt

3 Replies to posts in the url (can be a group or profile as well). : used to reply to posts containing the query with a message you want. (can reply to posts with specific time delta)

4 Post to multiple pages. : same as the first option but in gets text file containing links to post to 

In order to run this script simply install selenium using pip:
pip installs selenium

Download geckodiver from the mozilla github page and extract it to the script folder and you're good to go.
if you wish to extract it to another place, keep in mind to change the path of the binary in the code itself
